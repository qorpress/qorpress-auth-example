#### Docker (quick)

This version allows to run the example with mysql container.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/qorpress/qorpress-auth-example
docker-compose up --build
open http://localhost:4000
```

#### Locally (for dev)

### To do
* compile templates into an asset.go file
* multi-stage docker builder
* use the i18 package for loading login/register form translation

### Bugs
* cannot not use go.mod as it doesn't not copy template files (that's why we are using glide)
